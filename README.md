# Milestone Project 2

[Live Link to project here](https://rishisood1.github.io/Memory-Game-MS2/)

This is my second project for Code Institute. For my project I decided to make a memory game in which users would try to make matches with the cards in order to complete the game in the shortest amount of time and least number of moves. 
The user will click on the cards and if they match the cards will stay open and if they do not the cards will flip back round. 
Once all the cards have been matched a modal will appear on the screen. 
The modal will consist of the number of moves the user did and how long it took them to complete the game. 
The game was created to be suitable for all ages
